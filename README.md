# Web Notifications Demo

Web Notifications Demo is a simple demo app I put together to complement a talk about the Web Notifications API.

It's wrapped in a very basic Vue.js app and shows the basics of the API's with increasingly complex examples.

## Build Setup

Just run clone this and run yourself a good old fashioned `yarn install` or `npm install`, followed by `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to get the app up and running.
